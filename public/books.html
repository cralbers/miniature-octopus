      <h3>The Things They Carried</h3>
      <h4>Tim O'Brien</h4>
      <p>finished 8/28/2022</p>
      <p>still as heartbreaking as i remember. some of it makes me sick to my stomach to think about. i think a lot of it was a love story </p>

      <h3>Timescape</h3>
      <h4>Gregory Benford</h4>
      <p>finished 8/26/2022</p>

    <div id="our homesick songs">
      <h3>Our Homesick Songs</h3>
      <h4>Emma Hooper</h4>
      <p>finished 8/21/2022</p>
      <p>about a family who breaks because they love their home, and a boy who calls the fish home with his trucks and a girl who aches to prove that the world is big enough for good things. made my lungs ache but in a good way, like i had drowned for a little while in the sea but then came up for air.</p>
